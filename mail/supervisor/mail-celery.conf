; celery beat supervisor example
; ========================================

; Name of my supervisord program
[program:mail-celery]

; Set full path to celery program if using virtualenv
command=/home/mail/.virtualenvs/mail/bin/celery worker -A mail --loglevel=INFO

; The directory to my Django project
directory=/home/mail/mail

; If supervisord is run as the root user, switch users to this UNIX user account
; before doing any processing.
user=nobody

; Supervisor will start as many instances of this program as named by numprocs
numprocs=1

; Put process stdout output in this file
stdout_logfile=/home/mail/logs/celery.log

; Put process stderr output in this file
stderr_logfile=/home/mail/logs/celery.log

; If true, this program will start automatically when supervisord is started
autostart=true

; May be one of false, unexpected, or true. If false, the process will never
; be autorestarted. If unexpected, the process will be restart when the program
; exits with an exit code that is not one of the exit codes associated with this
; processâ€™ configuration (see exitcodes). If true, the process will be
; unconditionally restarted when it exits, without regard to its exit code.
autorestart=true


; The total number of seconds which the program needs to stay running after
; a startup to consider the start successful.
startsecs=10

; Need to wait for currently executing tasks to finish at shutdown.
; Increase this if you have very long running tasks.
stopwaitsecs = 600

stopasgroup=true

; Set Celery priority higher than default (999)
; so, if rabbitmq is supervised, it will start first.
priority=1000
